            <p>I am naturally inquisitive person who finds himself in a constant state of curiosity. I feed this 
              curiosity by learning and exploring aspects of data science with a special interest in data preparation
              and visualization. 
            </p>
            <p>I thrive on bringing creative thinking, effective design and problem solving to communicating and 
              distilling datasets down to deliver key insights. These insights are the fuel 
                to data-driven decisions.
            </p>
