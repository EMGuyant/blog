description: The analysis of historic performance of a hypothetical 3 asset portfolio. The historic prices of Bitcoin, the S&P 500, and gold since 2014 were analyzed to answer (1) how does the historic performance of Bitcoin compare to that of the S&P 500 and gold, (2) How does the inclusion of Bitcoin impact a portfolios characteristics, (3) could Bitcoin be used as a hedge against inflation, and (4) what allocation of the three asset classes produced the minimum volatility portfolio and what allocation produced the maximized risk-adjusted return.
